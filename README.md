# zpoly
zig polynomial tools for real and complex coefficients

Implements polynomial root finding, and basic polynomial functions.

* root finding
* multiplication
* addition
* evaluation
* pretty printing
* etc.

The root finding code follows D.A. Bini, "Numerical computation of polynomial zeros by means of Aberth's method", Numerical Algorithms, Feb 1996.
