# zpoly
zig polynomial tools for real and complex coefficients


Provides native zig implmentations of:  polynomial root finding, and basic polynomial functions.

* root finding
* multiplication
* addition
* evaluation
* pretty printing
* etc.

(The julia source code is not needed, but may be used to verify test case results.)

The root finding code follows D.A. Bini, "Numerical computation of polynomial zeros by means of Aberth's method", Numerical Algorithms, Feb 1996.
